# Victoria 3 Parser / World Shatterer

- Forked from Caracus
- updated to 1.1.2
- added all possible formable nations to country_formation and country_definitions as well (so they are formable now)
- also added hungary as formable (not the KUK, but HUN, added 3 croatian nations as well to their states as hungarian homeland)
- for easy usage, just download the content of the mod folder to your C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria 3\mod\

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What does this do?

### Shows how one can parse Victoria 3 files and combine them to create something like the "Every state a country mod"

## Background/Disclaimer

When Victoria 3 came out I wanted to learn Kotlin and Regex and so decided to try/learn it by turning every Victoria 3 state into its own country.
So expect the code niveau to be on a beginner level and the Regex to be suboptimal ;)

### Built With

- Kotlin
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA (any other compatible IDEA will do just fine)

### How to use it
I suggest using the IntelliJ IDEA which has a free community edition. 
Download the latest version from GitHub and import the project into the IDEA via the pom.xml which will then be used to build the project.

#### Code:
If you want to take a look at the code you can start under src/main/kotlin/.../ShatterTheWorld.kt

#### Every state a country mod:
Can be found under the mod folder. You can also copy and rename the mod if you want to run the Steam mod with custom changes on your side.

### How to contribute
Best to hit me up via Steam, just leave a comment on my profile page or the mod
