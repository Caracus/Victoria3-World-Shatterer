# Victoria 3 Parser / World Shatterer

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What does this do?

### Shows how one can parse Victoria 3 files and combine them to create something like the "Every state a country mod"

## Background/Disclaimer

When Victoria 3 came out I wanted to learn Kotlin and Regex and so decided to try/learn it by turning every Victoria 3 state into its own country.
So expect the code niveau to be on a beginner level and the Regex to be suboptimal ;)

2025: yupp the code is an eyesore to look at but simple and functional and so not worth putting in the effort to make it nice

### Built With

- Kotlin
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA (any other compatible IDEA will do just fine)

### How to use it
I suggest using the IntelliJ IDEA which has a free community edition. 
Download the latest version from GitHub and import the project into the IDEA via the pom.xml which will then be used to build the project.

#### Code:
Main file is under src/main/kotlin/.../ShatterTheWorld.kt

#### Every state a country mod:
Can be found under the mod folder. You can also copy and rename the mod if you want to run the Steam mod with custom changes on your side.
